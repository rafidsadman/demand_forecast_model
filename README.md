# demand_forecast_model
This repository includes all the codes of the demand forecast model that I created for Operations Management course at IBA. The main goal of the project was to devise multiple models and select the best one that will be capable of predicting the sales of the future from weather, historical sales, holidays and other variables.

The historical sales data was retreived from - https://www.kaggle.com/henslersoftware/19560-indian-takeaway-orders
and weather data from - https://www.wunderground.com
